description: I am Manuel Rademaker. I was a research assistant at the Chair of Econometrics at the Faculty of Business Administration and Economics at the University of WÃ¼rzburg until November 2020. Being interested and skilled in statistics, data science,  and programming (mostly in R but now more and more Python), I am currently looking for a job that lets me best put these skills into production!
