  Hi, I am Manuel Rademaker!

This is about me from, let's call it, an internal perspective. The
"hard facts" such as when I was born, where I studied, what is my work
experience etc. can be found in my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf). This section here is rather 
about my views on the üåç
and an attempt to give you a peak into the process that governs my thinking and
the way I see the world, which, combined with my [CV](/cv/cv.pdf), the [project portfolio](/project) and [my blog](/blog), should give you a 
good sense of who I am.
