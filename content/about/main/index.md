intro: | 
  First things first: I am the proud father of an adorable little daughter named 
  Fiona who is objectively, without any doubt, unchallenged the cutest baby in 
  the world (sorry everyone else ðŸ¤·).  

  Now, that being said, as you may have guessed from reading my blog posts, my 
  primary interests lies in what could roughly be subsumed as data science, 
  i.e. subjects such as statistics, machine learning, data extraction,
  data visualization and programming in general (mostly R but recently more 
  and more Python). 
  
  More generally, though, I'd describe myself as genuinely curious about the world
  and the human species. 
  I like to understand how things function. For me, understanding or solving a 
  particular task is a simple cause for satisfaction. Whether it is economics, 
  politics, financial markets, cryptocurrencies, the human mind, relationships 
  between people (and all the joy and suffering they cause), or the functioning 
  of a society as a whole, there are just so many interesting thing out there to 
  be thought about
  
  ### Thinking
  
  If I had to describe my thinking in one word, I'd probably pick: "**Bayesian**". 
  I consider everything I know or belief to be true as inherently conditional 
  on the information I have at my disposal right at that moment, i.e., what I 
  have experienced and learned throughout my life. As I process new information 
  I combine that information with my prior knowledge, compare the outcome to my 
  reference system and update my prior belief if inconsistent with the reference 
  system. I will explain what I mean by that system in the next section below.
  
  In my opinion, both self-reflectivness and openness are necessary conditions 
  for this process to take place. For one, to realize that some prior belief is
  inconsistent with new evidence requires self-reflectivness to cognitively
  understand what these beliefs and biases actually are and how they influence ones
  thinking. Openness on the other hand is required to allow a change of beliefs 
  to happen. 
  
  Naturally, this is rather idealistic in a sense that no matter how 
  self-reflected or open a person may be there are probably always some deeply 
  rooted beliefs and biases that are resilient or at least very difficult to
  change. No one is completely bias-free, I, for one, am not! However, there 
  is a huge difference between being indifferent to ones biases and actively 
  trying to understand and address them. I dare to claim I follow the latter.
  
  To talk about my thinking (and actions that follow) in a more operational sense,
  I'd say I generally follow a **pracmatic first principles thinking** approach.
  When facing a task I typically break the problem into pieces and study them
  in order to build my understanding from bottom up. I assume engineers can relate here.
  However, depending on the complexity of the problem, dismantling may just
  be beyond my (current) limitations given that time is unfortunately a scarce resource.
  Or to put it differently: I am not Elon Musk (not sure if I would even want to be ðŸ˜¬).
  Even if I had realized that the way rockets were build was largely inefficient 
  before SpaceX entered the market, even then, I don't think there would have 
  been enough time for me to efficiently build a rocket myself. 
  
  Of course, limits can be pushed. I do not belief limits are static. Yet, I belief
  I have a fairly good sense of how much time and and effort it takes to push a
  certain limit further. Some simply take longer than others. I therefore tend to
  focus on those limits that I belief are most easily (and therefore most effectively)
  pushed further out! 
  
  Given that an unconditional first principles approach is simply not feasible 
  for me I've learned to embrace the advantages of pragmatism when resources are scarce:
  understanding just enough about a problem to deliver a satisfactory
  outcome is in many instances the most effective approach. Hence, I think its 
  appropriate to claim that I am pragmatic and solution-oriented whenever
  a problem or projects involves constrains - which is, of course, always the
  case in a business context.
  
  ### My reference system
  
  Ok, so what is my reference system? Without going into the depth 
  of philosophy (just a little bit, though), it is more or less **the empirical world**.
  I belief that empirical observations are the closest indicator of the truth of
  some claim. Seeing, to take a very stark example, a hospital full of Covid-19 
  patients is fairly 
  strong evidence that SARS-COV-2 is indeed as dangerous as the measures taken 
  against its spread would indicate (ignoring all other serious medical or 
  epidemiological evidence pointing in the same direction for the sake of argument). 
  Given that several 
  people across different
  countries seem to deny that connection, indicates that they clearly do not refer
  to the empirical world as their reference system. This highlights how crucial a common
  reference system is for any discussion to be meaningful. 
  
  Having said that, I do not believe empirical evidence is all there is to this world, 
  since I also believe that, quoting M. Rees here: 
  
  *"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."*
  
  I am therefore generally reluctant to talk about something as being 
  universally true without explicitly stating what reference system I use 
  to evaluate any statement against. Likewise, I belief that whenever the 
  seal of truth is claimed for some argument, it should be clear what 
  reference system is to be used to verify that claim.
  
  ### My goals
  
  Clearly, I've many goals in life. Some are more immediate, others are more long-term.
  However, the underlying motivation could be summarized in an optimization problem 
  as follows:
  
  *I strive to maximize happiness or joy in the moment subject to the constraint* 
  *that I can do the same in the future.*
  
  Happiness in this case is not meant in a hedonistic sense. I don't consider
  happiness to be a state of saturation where one would not want to move, learn
  or continue to grow ([yes Einstein](https://www.wordsandquotes.com/text/happy-as-a-pig-albert-einstein), I disagree!) In fact, I don't even consider
  happiness as something to be reached but rather as an ingredient inherent in
  virtually anything I do or sense. Consequently, there are possibly infinitely
  many life trajectories that can be considered optimal - at least as long as one
  doesn't limit the space of possible sources of happiness for no good reason. 
  Isn't that highly encouraging? I do believe so. Indeed, it is the main the 
  reasons why I would describe myself as genuinely optimistic!
  
  Apart from all the people I meet in my life - my family, my wonderful wife 
  and my daughter - one of my biggest sources of happiness has been the act of 
  learning and growing. It's surprisingly difficult to explain why, but I guess 
  it may not even be necessary to fully understand it. I'd even say that, for me, 
  learning, updating, growing **is** the "meaning of life" even without some 
  ultimate goal but simply as an act in itself.
  
  ### Me from my perspective
  
  Although every individuals personality lies in some high dimensional character
  space, the following is an attempt to describe myself using a subset of these
  (the principal components so to speak). If you know me personally or ever get to
  know me, feel free to come back here and compare your view with mine â˜º.
  
  Here we go, this is me from my perspective:
  
  - open-minded
  - self-aware / self-reflected
  - curious about the world
  - self-confident
  - passionate about what I do
  - optimistic realist
  - emphatic
  - honest
  - motivated
  - solution-oriented
  - resourceful
  - persistent
  - balanced
