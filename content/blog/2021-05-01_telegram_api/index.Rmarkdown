During lockdown my friends and I started having regular quiz nights via
zoom. The winner of the last quiz would be the host and the others answer 
questions from varying categories by sending their answers as a text via Telegram
to the host. My wife would than copy-paste these answers in an Excel file and 
evaluate -- not a particularly effective process. We thought about shared documents
and alike, however, no satisfactory solution was agreed upon. As I started 
learning Python a couple of weeks ago, I thought it would much more 
effective (and a good exercise) to use Python to read the answers from the 
texts, process them and finally write them to an Excel file. 
Turns out to be easier than I thought.

# Step 1: Sign up for Telegram

# Step 2: Setup

# Step 3: Parse and process

# Step 4: Write to Excel
