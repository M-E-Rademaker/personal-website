<p>During lockdown my friends and I started having regular quiz nights via Zoom. Initially, I was the host. In subsequent rounds the winner of the last quiz would be the host and the others answer questions from varying categories by sending their answers as a text via Telegram to the host. My wife would than copy-paste these answers in an Excel file and evaluate â€“ not a particularly effective process. We thought about shared documents and alikes, however, no satisfactory solution was agreed upon. As I started learning Python a couple of weeks ago, I thought it would be much more effective (and a good exercise for that matter) to use Python to read the answers from the texts, process them and finally write them to an Excel file. Turns out to be easier than I thought.</p>
