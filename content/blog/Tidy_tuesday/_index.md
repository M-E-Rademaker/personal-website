  title: R Tidy Tuesday analysis

    I consider data analysis just like a sport: to become or stay good at it, 
    regular training is required. In this series, I analyze interesting data sets 
    provided by the great 
    [R Tidy Tuesday data project](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) 
    as a mean "to stay in shape".
  
    **(Self-inflicted) rules**: *I give myself roughly 90 minutes for the analysis
    and an extra 30 minutes for documenting.* 
    
    Needless to say, the analysis and the documentation are not meant to be 
    exhaustive and perfect. 
    
    I try to write one or two of these analysis per month.

    Tidy Tuesday was born out of the [R4DS (R for data science) Online Learning
    Community](https://www.rfordatasci.com/) and the 
    [R for Data Science textbook](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. 
    Every week a "tamed" new data set (i.e. data is partly preprocessed but not 
    completely tidy) alongside an article or a source is posted on the
    [Tidy Tuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 
    
    The goal is to explore this data set using
    data wrangling and summarizing techniques and (lots of) insightful
    visualizations.
